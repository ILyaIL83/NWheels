Aspects of NWheels
========

## NWheels is a Recipe

NWheels implements architectural recipes that address the whole story of typical enterprise applications. Among various aspects, the architecture covers: data persistence and caching, multiple flavors of business logic organization, user interface on multiple platforms/devices, B2B integrations, testability, extensibility and customization, scalability and resilience, and DevOps/ALM toolchain. 

## NWheels is an Interface

Rather than being a monolith that attempts to solve every problem, NWheels only solves one problem, and it does it well. It defines a consistent API, and supplies a set of core services to pluggable modules. It is then pluggable modules that define application capabilities, productivity frameworks, and technology choices.

> #### Frameworks to Your Taste 
> 
> Even application frameworks are by themselves pluggable modules. For instance, NWheels initially supplies DDD (domain-driven design), Workflow, and UIDL (user interface definition language) frameworks. Those can be replaced by, or combined with frameworks of different flavors, if so is beneficial for solving the problem at hand. 

## NWheels is Generator

NWheels reduces amount of application code, down to implementation of unique features. Great deal of reduction comes from reuse of building block domains and technology stack adapters. Still, there are concrete application models, which have to be mapped onto generic infrastructure mechanisms. 

Those mappings are traditionally captured by implicit layers of mechanical code, considered integral part of application models. NWheels removes this burden by generating such code through pipelines of pluggable conventions - an approach, which by product wins decoupling from  underlying frameworks and technology.

> #### DDD at Discount Price
> 
> For instance, code generation significantly lowers costs of implementing domain-driven design (DDD) in code. DDD approach, while recognized for its benefits, has the downside of being an expensive undertaking. NWheels code generators remove most of the programming effort required to implement DDD in code. This makes DDD (or at least its tactical patterns) a profitable choice for much wider range of applications.

## NWheels is Home

NWheels is aimed to become a place where collective expertise in enterprise application development is accumulated and shared. Collaboration and sharing is possible though development of reusable and adaptive NWheels modules, such as building block domains, technology stack adapters, and example applications, as well as contribution to the surrounding ecosystem of developer resources.

## NWheels is Open Source Software

We believe that code sharing and collaboration, driven by enthusiasm for quality and for professionalism, have much better chances of delivering working and (re)usable software, rather than isolated development driven by sales plan of a profit-oriented organization.
