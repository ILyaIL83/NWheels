Hapil requests

1. Implementation class writer: DependencyField is not sufficient, still needed to write constructor
2. Property writer: .Throw<>() shortcut is not implemented
3. Event writer: has no .Throw<>() shortcut 
4. Event writer: probably(?) uses TT.TEventHandler instead of TT.TEventArgs
5. Method writer: is missing ArgumentCount property and enumerable of arguments (had to revert to ParameterInfo[] and their Position property is confusing, easily making Hapil-based code buggy)
6. Method writer: Argument<T>(int) does not perform type check against method declaration - must shout loud in case of mismatch
7. CastTo<T>() operation needs to perform type safety check if possible, to shout loud early
