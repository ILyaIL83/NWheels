NWheels does all of the heavy lifting, and comes equipped with ready solutions to all kinds of common problems faced by the majority of enterprise applications (examples: customizable entity model, claims-based authorization, support for scalability and fault tolerance, just to name a few). Unique features of a concrete application are developed on top of NWheels' programming model. The programming model, among with providing infrastructure services, helps ensure that all the code in the application is well structured and follows common design patterns prescribed by NWheels.
