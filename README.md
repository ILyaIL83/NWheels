NWheels is an A-to-Z architectural recipe and implementation framework for development of enterprise applications based on the Microsoft .NET platform. 

Building an enterprise application with NWheels means following a comprehensive set of field proven patterns and practices, which together comprise robustly architectured solution. 

NWheels does all of the heavy lifting, and comes equipped with ready solutions to all kinds of common problems faced by the majority of enterprise applications (customizable entity model, claims-based authorization, support for scalability and fault tolerance, are just a few examples to name). 

Unique features of a concrete application are developed on top of NWheels programming model. Among with exposing infrastructure services, the programming model helps ensure that common architectural principles are followed uniformly throughout the code base.

NWheels is both technology agnostic and provides adapters to most commonly used technology stacks. Custom stack adapter modules can be plugged in as well.
